ðŸ“š Before You Start: What Youâ€™ll Need

Before diving into Phase 1, make sure youâ€™ve got a solid grip on the basics. Hereâ€™s everything I personally followed and recommend â€” these are the exact resources I used in my journey:

ðŸ›  Tools Youâ€™ll Need

âœ… Xilinx Vivado â€“ Download the student version from the official Xilinx site. Itâ€™s free, powerful, and essential for synthesis, simulation, and bitstream generation.

ðŸŽ“ Courses That Built My Foundation

ðŸ”¹ NPTEL Course: "Hardware Modeling Using Verilog" by Prof. Indranil Sengupta Sir â€“ this is hands down one of the best structured and practical introductions to Verilog out there.

ðŸ“˜ Books That Helped Me

verilog HDL a Guide to Digital Design and Synthesis by Samir Palnitkar. Clear explanations, practical RTL examples, and aligned with industry-level concepts.


Prerequisites

To truly get the most out of this journey, make sure you're comfortable with:

ðŸ”¸ C Programming â€“ You donâ€™t need to be an expert, but basic logic, loops, conditionals, and functions are a must.
I personally learned from Neso Academy's C programming playlist â€” simple, clear, and well-explained.

ðŸ”¸ Digital Electronics â€“ Flip-flops, muxes, gates, FSMs â€” these are your bread and butter.
ðŸ“º You can refer either:

Engineering Funda (my favorite!)

Or Neso Academy, which is also great.

This will help you not just watch or copy, but really understand what weâ€™ll be doing in RTL coding, testbenches, synthesis, and beyond.
